Kudo Box is an app to implement the kudo reward system within an organization.

Our idea is to lean meteor with a real application example.





Run the Application
===================

This application is developed using Meteor 6.4.1 and some extra packages managed on atmosphere, so that it requires
meteorite (follow the installation procedure here: https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite).

Make sure all the packages have been correctly installed running the command:
> mrt install

Run command:
> mrt

Connect to mongodb:
> mrt mongo
